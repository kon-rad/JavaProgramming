Trinity: I know why you're here, Neo. I know what you've been doing... why you
hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night, you sit by your
computer. You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the
same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him.
I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us, Neo. It's the
question that brought you here. You know the question, just as I did.
Neo: What is the Matrix?
Trinity: The answer is out there, Neo. It's looking for you, and it will find
you if you want it to.
- The Matrix
